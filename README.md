# Test-challenge-3
What PyBank takes you through:

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

What PyPoll takes you through:

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote



Throughout the task of completing these two sections I struggled most wiht the PyPoll. For both projects I started off going over previous class activites.

I then used my tutoring session to go over the challenge, which guided me through most of my final work.

In between when I was having issues I googled how to do certain tasks, such as cloning my reposity but ultimately found that using the BCS learning asistant was the best choice.

BCS learning helped me clone my repository and attempted to guide me in the right direction for certain tasks I was struggling on
